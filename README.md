# Solving-The-Maze
Lab 4 for MEGN 441: extension of Lab 3 Maze traversal, but instead of providing the robot with prior information, the robot is expected to use sensing (IR sensor in the front and a ultrasonic sensor on its left) to explore the maze using wall following, and then optimally reduce its exploration traversal to find the best path through the maze.
